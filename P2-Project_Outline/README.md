# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will introduce users to Microgreens,
what they are, how they are grown, what nutritional value they provide,
and how they are used in foods and dishes.  Users will be able to create
an account, log in, create and edit an order, and place an order for 
delivery. Deliveries can be completed if the customer lives within a
25 mile radius of my home.Users will also have the option of joining
a mailing list and my virtual social group “My Microgreen Garden” for 
microgreen enthusiasts!

Growing Microgreens became my new hobby with the onset of COVID and the 
restrictions that came along with it.  As a means to learn something new 
and use my time productively, I watched hundreds of YouTube videos on how 
to grow microgreens, and the benefits they provide.   I decided to try to 
grow them, and the next thing I knew I was selling them at Farmers Markets 
and to local restaurants!  This application will not only keep my
customer base informed of what I have available, but it will also educate 
users to the benefits of microgreens and attract new customers.


### Features

A Web page:  Users will be provided with general information about microgreens 
and specific information about the microgreens I am offering.

Links:  Provide links to display nutritional value, recipes and how
microgreens are grown.

User Registry: Users will be able to register a profile so 
they can create an account and become a member of My Microgreen Garden, 
which enables them to receive my newsletter and be authorized to order for a delivery.

User Login:  Once Users have submitted a profile, they will be able to login to their account using password authentication.

CRUD: Users will be able to Create, edit and delete items from
their order.  Order history will be maintained.

The distance to deliver will be determined by adding a location feature,
to ensure that the delivery is within range.


### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Thymeleaf templates
Bootstrap


### What I'll Have to Learn

I am not very familiar with implementing authentication, and I'll 
have to work on how to indicate how a user will ‘favorite’ an item.  
I will have to learn how to develop a mailing list from my user
profiles, and how to respond to users if they place an order. 
Additionally, I will have to figure out how to use a distance
calculator.  I would like to use TDD, as I certainly need some greater
experience in that area.
